2. COOKIES AND AUTOMATIC DATA COLLECTION

We store certain information that gets collected automatically at our end through cookies and other similar technologies. A cookie is a small string of information that a website that you visit transfers to your browser for identification purposes. Cookies can be used to follow your activity while using a website or across websites, and that information helps companies understand your preferences and tendencies, as well as improve and personalize your website experience. Some cookies are necessary to operate a website, while others can be functional or analytical. Cookies on the TECH41 Website are generally divided into the following categories:
Strictly Necessary Cookies. These are required for the operation and security of the TECH41 Website. These include, for example, cookies that optimize website security and to detect and prevent fraud.
Analytical/Performance Cookies. These allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors to the TECH41 Website and understand how such users navigate through the TECH41 Website (e.g., when and which pages are visited, in what order the pages are visited, and where a user is located).
We also use Google Analytics for part of this process. For more information about Google Analytics, please visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. Google provides users with the ability to prevent their data from being used by Google Analytics—learn more by going to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
Functional Cookies. These improve the functional performance of the TECH41 Website and make it easier for you to use. These cookies qualify as persistent cookies because they remain on your device for use during your next visit to the TECH41 Website. You can delete these cookies as detailed below.
You can also prevent the use of certain cookies by modifying your Internet browser settings, typically under the sections “Help,” “Internet Options,” or “Settings.” If you disable or delete certain cookies in your Internet browser settings, you may still access the TECH41 Website, however, you might not be able to access or use important functions or features of the TECH41 Website.

We also work with third-party analytics companies and advertising networks to understand how our Applications are used and to display advertisements that we believe will be relevant to you. We use AdMob from Google for part of this process. You can opt out of personalized advertisements under the “Settings” section of our Applications.

Do-Not-Track Signals
At this time, we do not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which include “do-not-track” instructions.
